I had hosted a relatively modest personal site for a number of years, but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I felt inspired enough to begin hosting my own software, open source projects, more refined blog etc.<p>This post is a short one - and is targeted to those perhaps getting started in this space. All I want to say is that you should take the time, just as you would if deploying a large production system, in your developer tooling. Building, deploying and launching your own software should be fun, but you know whats not fun (except to anarchsists)? Manual deployments, silent broken builds, or having to ssh into your VPS to deal with a systemctl configuration issue.<p>Take the time when setting up whatever you're setting up, to make it as easy as possible to ship your code! This is so obvious in the software engineering world, but since my mindset was always "eh its just my personal site", it took me far too long to get to this point.<p>The added friction to just simply writing a new blog post, or <a href=https://github.com/rupert648/pert.dev/blob/main/services/glance/glance.yml>updating my glance config</a> meant that my lazy ass just became uninspired to do any of it.<p>So, PSA: take the couple of hours to write your build and deployment scripts for your crappy little personal project, it'll inspire you to work on it more once the boring stuff is out the way. These can be as minimal or inventive as you'd like (<a href=https://pert.dev/posts/easy-pr-previews/>read my blog about creating your own pr preview deployments please!</a>).
